# Directional Commands Update

## Overview
Players can now use directional commands directly without needing the `go` prefix.

## Changes Made

### Before
Players had to type:
- `go north` to move north
- `go south` to move south
- etc.

### After
Players can now type either:
- `north` (or `n`) to move north directly
- `go north` (still supported for backwards compatibility)

## Supported Directions

All directional commands work both with and without the `go` prefix:

- **North**: `north`, `n`, or `go north`
- **South**: `south`, `s`, or `go south`
- **East**: `east`, `e`, or `go east`
- **West**: `west`, `w`, or `go west`
- **Up**: `up`, `u`, or `go up`
- **Down**: `down`, `d`, or `go down`

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Files
- `app/systems/commands.py`

### Key Changes

1. **Modified `process_command()` method**:
   - Detects when a directional command is used
   - Passes the direction command itself to `cmd_move()`

2. **Updated `cmd_move()` method**:
   - Now accepts the direction command as a parameter
   - Contains full movement logic (previously was a placeholder)
   - Maps short commands (n, s, e, w, u, d) to full directions
   - Updates character's room_id and x/y/z coordinates
   - Returns room information and broadcasts movement to other players

3. **Retained `cmd_go()` method**:
   - Kept for backwards compatibility
   - Players who prefer "go north" can still use that syntax

4. **Updated help text**:
   - Updated to show that directions can be used directly
   - Notes that "go <direction>" is still available

## Usage Examples

```
> north
You go north to Village Inn.

> s
You go south to Village Square.

> go east
You go east to Blacksmith's Shop.

> w
You go west to Village Square.

> up
You go up to Inn Bedroom.

> down
You go down to Village Inn.
```

## Coordinate Tracking

Movement commands automatically update:
- `character.current_room_id` - The room database ID
- `character.x_coord` - X coordinate
- `character.y_coord` - Y coordinate  
- `character.z_coord` - Z coordinate

## Room Broadcasting

When a character moves:
- The character sees: "You go [direction] to [room name]."
- Other players in the origin room see: "[character name] goes [direction]."
- The character automatically receives the new room description

## Error Handling

The system provides clear error messages:
- "You can't go [direction] from here." - If no exit exists in that direction
- "You are not in a room" - If character's location is invalid
- "Target room not found." - If the exit points to a non-existent room

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add diagonal directions (northeast, southwest, etc.)
- Add special movement commands (jump, climb, swim)
- Add movement speed/cost based on character stats
- Add terrain effects on movement
