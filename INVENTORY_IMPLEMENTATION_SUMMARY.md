## How Players Use It

### Opening Inventory
```
Method 1: Press 'I' key
Method 2: Type 'inventory' or 'i' command
Method 3: Click inventory button (if added to UI)
```

### Closing Inventory
```
- Press Escape key
- Click X button in header
- Click outside modal (on dark overlay)
```

### Reorganizing Items
```
1. Click and hold any item
2. Drag to desired slot
3. Release to drop
4. Item moves to new position
```

### Managing Bags
```
1. Drag bag/pouch/container to quick bag slot (1-5)
2. Bag equips automatically
3. Inventory capacity increases
4. Click equipped bag to unequip (with confirmation)
```

## Technical Highlights

### Client-Side Command Handling
```javascript
// Commands handled without server round-trip
if (cmdLower === 'inventory' || cmdLower === 'i') {
    this.addOutput(`> ${command}`, 'command');
    openInventoryModal();
    return; // Don't send to server
}
```

### Smart Modal State Management
```javascript
function isModalOpen() {
    const characterModal = document.getElementById('character-modal');
    const inventoryModal = document.getElementById('inventory-modal');
    return (characterModal && characterModal.style.display !== 'none') ||
           (inventoryModal && inventoryModal.style.display !== 'none');
}
```

### Drag State Tracking
```javascript
let draggedItemId = null;
let draggedFromSlotIndex = null;
let dragType = null; // 'bag' or 'reorder'
```

### Automatic Inventory Loading
```javascript
function openInventoryModal() {
    const modal = document.getElementById('inventory-modal');
    modal.style.display = 'flex';
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    loadInventory(); // Auto-load when opening
}
```

def reorder_inventory(character_id):
    # Update item positions in database
    pass
```
